Serialization/Deserialization
-----------------------------
For the classes that you want to be serialized, all you need to do is build a factory for it at the start of the program. 
If this class also has additional member variables that you want to be serialized, you implement a serialization and 
deserialization function (a good example can be found in Agent.cpp), but for classes that don't this is not required.
